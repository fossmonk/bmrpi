BMRPI
-----
Collection of baremetal experiments in Raspberry Pi 4. Makefile is written for aarch64 compiler tools for Windows (because I am lazy). May add support for linux as well later. Endgoal is to have some graphics based "games" which can run baremetal on the RPI4. Now trying to get a test boot to work.
